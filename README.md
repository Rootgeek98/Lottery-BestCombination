How to choose your lottery numbers ? 
========================================================

## Goal 

The goal of this analysis is to optimize winnings of a lottery by playing the less played combination and reducing the probability to share the winnings.

![I don't always win at the lottery, but when I do ...](http://imgur.com/ePF600T.png)


## How ?

The idea is to:

1. Analyze the pasts  results of the lottery *(number of winners for each draw)*
2. Deduce the playing frequency of each combination. 
<br/>  *Basically, if there is more winner than usual when the draw is 1-2-3-4-5, we can deduce this combination has a high playing frequency.*
3. Play the combination win the lower playing frequency in order to reduce the probability of sharing the winnings


## Context

This analysis has been inspired by [Using ML To Pick Your Lottery Numbers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.onewinner.me/en/devoxxML.ipynb) of [C.Bourguignat](https://twitter.com/chris_bour)

The goal is the same *(reduce the probability to share the winnings)* but the approach is different.
A comparaison of these approaches is availabe at the end.


## Illustrative example

Let's imagine a fake lottery, the **LoToTo**:

* 2 numbers to pick among 5 numbers *(from 1 to 5)* .
* 10 combinations possibles : [1-2] [1-3] [1-4] [1-5] [2-3] [2-4] [2-5] [3-4] [3-5] [4-5]

The LoToTo organizer know for each combination the proportion of tickets played on it:

| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Tickets' proportion|
|----------:|----------:|-------------------:|
|          1|          2|                0.20|
|          1|          3|                0.15|
|          1|          4|                0.15|
|          1|          5|                0.05|
|          2|          3|                0.15|
|          2|          4|                0.10|
|          2|          5|                0.05|
|          3|          4|                0.05|
|          3|          5|                0.05|
|          4|          5|                0.05|

Some of the 10 combinations are more played than others, because people are not creative:
* Combination [1-2] is the most played *(20% of the players played this combination)*
* Combinations [2-5] [3-4] [3-5] and [4-5] are the less played *(5% of the players played each of these combination)*

If we want to reduce the risk of sharing the winnings, we should played one of the less played : [2-5], [3-4], [3-5], [4-5] 

### Estimation of the playing frequency of each combination

**Problem** : these playing frequencies are hidden by the Lototo organizer.

So we should not be able to know which combination is the best one to play.
This is why we're gonna try to estimate these playing frequencies by studying the **public results of the past draws**:
| DrawId| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Tickets' frequency 0 match| Tickets' frequency 1 match| Tickets' frequency with 2 matches|
|------:|----------:|----------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------------:|
|      1|          1|          4|                       0.25|                       0.60|                              0.15|
|      2|          4|          5|                       0.50|                       0.45|                              0.05|
|      3|          1|          2|                       0.15|                       0.65|                              0.20|


#### Estimation by studying one draw result

For instance let's **study the 1st draw**:
| DrawId| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Tickets' frequency 0 match| Tickets' frequency 1 match| Tickets' frequency with 2 matches|
|------:|----------:|----------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------------:|
|      1|          1|          4|                       0.25|                       0.60|                              0.15|

* 15% of the tickets played  had 2 matches and [1-4] is the only combination with 2 matches.
   So [1-4] has been played by 15% of the tickets.

* 60% of the tickets played had 1 match and 6 combinations had 1 match : [1-2]  [1-3]  [1-5]  [2-4]  [3-4]  [4-5]. 
  As we said we don't known the playing frequency of these 6 combinations, that's why we assume each of them have been played by 10% of the tickets.
  
* 25% of the tickets played of this 1st draw had no match and 3 combinations had 0 match : [2-3] [2-5] [3-5].  
   As we said we don't known the playing frequency of these 3 combinations, that's why we assume each of them have been played by 8.33% of the tickets.

The analysis of the 1st draw result allowed us to have a estimation of the playing frequency of each combination.  

Let's compare:
* The real playing frequency *(which is not supposed to be known)*
* Our estimation done by studying the public results of the first draw
* A naive estimation which attibutes an equal frequency of 10% for each combination




```r
LoToTo.PlayingFreqEstimation.Using1stDrawResult
```

```
      1stNumber 2nd Number Real Playing Frequency
 [1,]         1          2                     20
 [2,]         1          3                     15
 [3,]         1          4                     15

 [2,]                      10.00               10
 [3,]                      15.00               10
 [4,]                      10.00               10
 [5,]                       8.33               10
 [6,]                      10.00               10
 [7,]                       8.33               10
 [8,]                      10.00               10
 [9,]                      10.00               10
[10,]                       8.33               10
```

We can see our estimator is more accurate than the naive one : 
* A better or similar accuracy for 9 combinations out of 10
* An Mean Absolute Error of 4,3 vs 5.0


### Estimation by studying all draws result

If we do the same with the results of the 3 past draws we obtain these 3 estimators:



```r
LoToTo.PlayingFreqEstimation.UsingAllDrawResults
```

```
      1st Number 2nd Number Real Frequency Est. using 1st Draw Result
 [1,]          1          2           0.20                       0.10
 [2,]          1          3           0.15                       0.10
 [3,]          1          4           0.15                       0.15
 [4,]          1          5           0.05                       0.10
 [5,]          2          3           0.15                       0.08
 [6,]          2          4           0.10                       0.10
 [7,]          2          5           0.05                       0.08
 [8,]          3          4           0.05                       0.10
 [9,]          3          5           0.05                       0.08
[10,]          4          5           0.05                       0.10
      Est. using 2nd Draw Result Est. using 3rd Draw Result
 [1,]                       0.17                       0.20
 [2,]                       0.17                       0.11
 [3,]                       0.08                       0.11
 [4,]                       0.08                       0.11
 [5,]                       0.17                       0.08
 [6,]                       0.08                       0.11
 [7,]                       0.08                       0.11
 [8,]                       0.08                       0.11
 [9,]                       0.08                       0.05
[10,]                       0.05                       0.05
```

Let's aggregate these 3 estimators into a single stronger estimator like a RandomForest aggregate several decision trees.

There is a several way to aggregate these 3 estimators (See Next-Steps) but here we sill simply aggregate them by doing a simple mean of their individual estimation: Est. aggregated = (Est. using 1st Draw Result + Est. using 2nd Draw Result +  Est. using 3rd Draw Result) /3



```r
LoToTo.PlayingFreqEstimation.UsingAllDrawResults.Aggregated
```

```
      1st Number 2nd Number Real Frequency Aggregated Est.
 [1,]          1          2           0.20            0.16
 [2,]          1          3           0.15            0.13
 [3,]          1          4           0.15            0.11
 [4,]          1          5           0.05            0.10
 [5,]          2          3           0.15            0.11
 [6,]          2          4           0.10            0.10
 [7,]          2          5           0.05            0.09
 [8,]          3          4           0.05            0.10
 [9,]          3          5           0.05            0.07
[10,]          4          5           0.05            0.07
```


We can see our new estimator using all the past lottery results is even more accurate than the estimator using only the last lottery result: 

* A better accuracy for 8 combinations out of 10 
* An Mean Absolute Error of 2.9 vs 4.3
* The estimator succeed to  recommanded 2 good combinations: [3-5] [4-5] which indeed have a low playing frequency.

Now you're familliar and convinced by the approach let's apply it to a real lottery : [EuroMillions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroMillions)

## Application to a real lottery: EuroMillions
![Let's pick the best numbers](http://i.imgur.com/bIOUoRB.png)

### Scope of the analysis
Unlike the LoToTo, the Euromillions consist of picking 5 numbers among 50 + 2 stars among 10 stars.

In order to keep this analysis comparable to the Using ML analysis, we will **focus on the 5 numbers only**.

Based on this 5 numbers among 50,  we will have to estimate the playing frequency of 2 118 760 combinations 



```
## 
## Attaching package: 'combinat'
## 
## L'objet suivant est masqué from 'package:utils':
## 
##     combn
```


```r
Grid= c(1:50)
Combinations = combn(Grid,5)
# 10 first combinations (1 per column)
Combinations = Combinations[,1:10]
```

**We'll use the methodology introduced in the LoToTo example**, *i.e*:

1.  Analyse each draw result in order to estimate the playing frequency of all combinations
2.  For each combination, we'll aggregate the 100 estimated playing frequency by into a single more accurate estimation.

### Data Preparation

#### Draws results Data

After each draw, the EuroMillions organizers communicate publicly the results. A website recover them since 2004 (745  draws) and sell them for 2 euros [here](http://www.loterieplus.com/euromillions/services/telechargement-resultat.php) 

I make available  the results of the last 100 draws here, with only the variable useful for this analysis *i.e* for each of the 100 draws:
*  N1, N2, N3 , N4, N5 : 5 numbers of the draw *(in an ascending order)*
*  Number of players on each rank:
  + Rank1:   5 matches & 2  good stars
  + Rank2:   5 matches & 1  good star
  + Rank3:   5 matches & 0  good star
  + Rank4:   4 matches & 2  good stars
  + Rank5:   4 matches & 1  good star
  + Rank6:   4 matches & 0  good star
  + Rank7:   3 matches & 2  good stars
  + Rank9:   3 matches & 1  good star
  + Rank10:  3 matches & 0  good star
  + Rank8:   2   matches & 2  good stars
  + Rank12:  2   matches & 1  good star
  + Rank11:  1  match & 2  good stars
  + Nb Tickets: number of tickets played (no matter the number of matches and/or good stars)

```

Since we decided to focus on numbers and not on the stars we need to aggregate all the ranks associated to the same number of matches

**Problem:** some numbers are missing and we can't compute the number of players with 2,1 or 0 matches without them.
Hopefully we can estiamte these numbers by using the [Winning Probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroMillions#Prize_structure)

* Number of players with:
  + 2   matches & 0 good star : can be estimated as twice the number of players in the Rank12 *(2 matches & 1  good star)*
  + 1   match & 1 good star : can be estimated as 18 times the number of players in the Rank11 *(1  matches & 2 good star)*
  + 1   match & 0 good star : : can be estimated as 36 times the number of players in the Rank11 *(1  matches & 2 good star)*
  + 0   match (no matter the number of good star) : can be estimated as the total number of players - the number of player with at least 1 match.
  
*A better estimation mechanism could be used, see Next-Steps*


```r
#Compute for each draw, the number of tickets for each number of matches

```

Let's now replace the numbers by frequencies in order to have comparable draws.

```r
Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_5_MATCHES = Draws$NB_TICKETS_5_MATCHES / Draws$NB_TICKETS
Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_4_MATCHES = Draws$NB_TICKETS_4_MATCHES / Draws$NB_TICKETS

### Estimation of the playing frequency of each combination

As we saw in the LoToTo example, for each draw, we will split the frequency of tickets with *m* matches to all the combinations having m matches with the draw, in order to estimate the playing frequency of each of these combinations.

No matter the draw, the number of combination with m matched numbers =
$\binom{45}{5-m} \times  \binom{m}{5}$

Then we know that for each draw there is:
* 1 combination having 5 matches 
* 225 combinations having 4  matches 
* 9 900 combinations having 3 matches 
* 141 900 combinations having 2 matches 
* 749 975 combinations having 1 match 
* 1 221 759 combinations having 0 match

So for each draw  we estimated the:
*  playing frequency of each combination with 0 match: = Frequency of tickets with 0 match / 1221759 
*  playing frequency of each combination with 1 match: = Frequency of tickets with 1 match / 749975
*  playing frequency of each combination with 2 matches: = Frequency of tickets with 2 matches / 141900
*  playing frequency of each combination with 3 matches: = Frequency of tickets with 3 matches / 9900
*  playing frequency of each combination with 4 matches: = Frequency of tickets with 4 matches / 225
*  playing frequency of each combination with 4 matches: = Frequency of tickets with 5 matches / 1



```r
Draws$FREQ_COMB_0 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_0_MATCH / 1221759 
Draws$FREQ_COMB_1 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_1_MATCH / 744975 
Draws$FREQ_COMB_2 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_2_MATCHES / 141900
Draws$FREQ_COMB_3 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_3_MATCHES / 9900
Draws$FREQ_COMB_4 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_4_MATCHES / 225
Draws$FREQ_COMB_5 = Draws$FREQ_TICKETS_5_MATCHES / 1

Draws = Draws[,-(7:12)] 
Draws = as.matrix(Draws)
head(Draws)
```

```
  DRAW_ID N1 N2 N3 N4 N5     FREQ_COMB_0     FREQ_COMB_1     FREQ_COMB_2
1       1  2 14 21 36 46 0.0000005232312 0.0000003960963 0.0000004325302
2       2 13 25 32 38 46 0.0000005678020 0.0000003312809 0.0000003879100
      FREQ_COMB_3     FREQ_COMB_4     FREQ_COMB_5
1 0.0000004230410 0.0000004057315 0.0000003428257
2 0.0000004381016 0.0000004651340 0.0000005330483
```


For exemple on the 1st draw, 6.14% of the tickets had 2 matches  and we know that 141 900 combinations shared 2 numbers with this draw, so we will estimate that each of these 141 900 combinations has been played by  SDFZEFDS (0.0614 /141900) of the tickets.
We just need to know which combination shared 2 numbers with this 1st draw and then we can assign them a estimated playing frequency equal to SDFZEFDS 

#### Number of Match between each draw and each combination

Before estimating the playing frequency of each combination we need to compute the number of match between each combinations and each draw.

The result is stored in a big matrix:
*  100 rows: 1 row per draw
*  2 118 760 columns : 1 column per combination 

```r
#Compare a single draw to a single combination
Comparison <- function(draw, combination) 
{ f <- function(x, y) { sum(x %in% y) }
  apply(combination, 2, f, x = draw)
}

# Compare all the draws to all the combinations, by using the previous function.
ComputeMatches = function(Draws, Combinations){
 Matches = matrix(nrow=nrow(Draws), ncol=ncol(Combinations))
  for(d in 1:nrow(Draws)) {Matches[d,] = Comparison( Draws[d,2:6], Combinations)}
  return(Matches)  
}
```


```r
Matches <- ComputeMatches(Draws, Combinations) 
Matches[1:2,1:10] # Number of matches between the first 5 draws and the first 10 combinations
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1     2
[2,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1     0
```
#### Playing frequency assignment based on the number of matches

We know know for each draw:
*  how to estimate the playing frequency of a combination based on the number of matches
*  the number of matches between the draw and each combination

So we can compute for each draw, the estimated playing frequency of each combination

```r
#Compute for each draw, the estimated playing frequency of each combiation
ComputePlayingFrequency = function(Draws, Matches){
  PlayingFrequency = matrix(nrow=nrow(Matches), ncol=ncol(Matches)) 
  for(d in 1:nrow(Draws)) {
    PlayingFrequency[d,] = Draws[d,7+Matches[d,]]
  }
  return(PlayingFrequency)  
}
```

ComputeGamingProbability = function(Tirage, SharedNumbers){
  GamingProbability = matrix(nrow=nrow(SharedNumbers), ncol=ncol(SharedNumbers)) 
  for(t in 1:nrow(Tirage)) {
    GamingProbability[t,] = Tirage[t,6+SharedNumbers[t,]]
  }
  return(GamingProbability)  
}




```r
PlayingFrequency  <- ComputePlayingFrequency(Draws, Matches)
PlayingFrequency [1:2,1:3] # 2 estimations (based on the first 2 draws) of the playing frequency of the 3 first combinations 
```

```
                [,1]            [,2]            [,3]
[1,] 0.0000003960963 0.0000003960963 0.0000003960963
[2,] 0.0000005678020 0.0000005678020 0.0000005678020
```


#### Agregation of the estimations

Like we did on the LoToTo example, we can aggregate the 100 estimations into a single stronger estimations like a RandomForest aggregate several decision trees.


```r
#ProbaCombinason
PlayingFrequencyAggregated = colMeans(PlayingFrequency)
PlayingFrequencyAggregated[1:3]
```

```
[1] 0.0000004819491 0.0000004819491 0.0000004819491
```


```r
#10 Most frequently played combinations (Don't play them :o )
Combinations[,order(-PlayingFrequencyAggregated)[1:10]]
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1     1
[2,]    2    2    2    2    2    2    2    2    2     2
[3,]    3    3    3    3    3    3    3    3    3     3
[4,]    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4     4
[5,]   14    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12    13
```

```r
# 10 Less frequently played combinations (Play these one instead :) )
Combinations[,order(PlayingFrequencyAggregated)[1:10]]
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1     1
[2,]    2    2    2    2    2    2    2    2    2     2
[3,]    3    3    3    3    3    3    3    3    3     3

```

## Next Steps

![We need to go deeper](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/content/images/2014/Aug/1386271588578.jpg)
This section in under cunstruction

*  Improve the way to aggregate the estimations. For instance, if for a  draw *d* a combination has 5 matches, we should only take into account the estimation associated to the this draw *d*.
*  Test the results significancy.
*  Perform the analysis in a recursive way:
  + Do the analysis like we did and recover an estimated  playing frequency for each combination.
  + Redo the analysis by using this distribution instead of an equal distribution for improving the way to "split the frequency of tickets with m matches to all the combinations having m matches"

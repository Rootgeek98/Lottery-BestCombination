### Data Preparation
Grid= c(1:50)

# Replace the numbers by frequencies in order to have comparable draws.

### Compute the number of matches between each Draw and each Combination.

### Estimations of the playing frequency of each combination

#Divide the frequency of tickets with m matches by the number combinations having m matches

### Aggregation of the estimations

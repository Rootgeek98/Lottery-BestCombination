Methodology 
========================================================

Here is an introductive example explaining the methodology of the analysis.

This lecture is highly recommended if you're not familliar with analyses about lottery numbers.

## Illustrative example

Let's imagine a fake lottery, the **Lototo**:

* 2 numbers to pick among 5 numbers *(from 1 to 5)*.
* 10 possibles combinations : [1-2] [1-3] [1-4] [1-5] [2-3] [2-4] [2-5] [3-4] [3-5] [4-5]

The Lototo organizer know for each combination the frequency of tickets played on it *(played frequency)*:

| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Playing frequency|
|----------:|----------:|-------------------:|
|          1|          2|                0.20|
|          1|          3|                0.15|
|          1|          4|                0.15|
|          1|          5|                0.05|
|          2|          3|                0.15|
|          2|          4|                0.10|
|          2|          5|                0.05|
|          3|          4|                0.05|
|          3|          5|                0.05|
|          4|          5|                0.05|

Some of the 10 combinations are more played than others, because people are not creative:
* Combination [1-2] is the most played *(20% of the tickets)*
* Combinations [2-5] [3-4] [3-5] and [4-5] are the less played *(5% of the tickets)*

If we want to reduce the risk of sharing the winnings, we should played: [2-5], [3-4], [3-5] or [4-5].

**Problem** : these playing frequencies are hidden by the Lototo organizer.

So we should not be able to know which combination is the best one to play.
This is why we're gonna try to estimate these playing frequencies by studying the **public results of the past draws**.

## Estimation of the playing frequency of each combination



The public results gives us for each draw:
*  A draw Id
*  The 2 winning numbers : 1st Number & 2nd Number *(in an ascending order)*
*  The proportion of tickets with 0, 1, and 2 matches

| Draw Id| 1st Number| 2nd Number|  0 match|  1 match|  2 matches|
|------:|----------:|----------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------------:|
|      1|          1|          4|                       0.25|                       0.60|                              0.15|
|      2|          4|          5|                       0.50|                       0.45|                              0.05|
|      3|          1|          2|                       0.15|                       0.65|                              0.20|


#### Estimation by studying one draw result

For instance let's study the **1st draw**:

| Draw Id| 1st Number| 2nd Number|  0 match| 1 match| 2 matches|
|------:|----------:|----------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------------:|
|      1|          1|          4|                       0.25|                       0.60|                              0.15|

* 15% of the tickets had 2 matches and [1-4] is the only combination with 2 matches.
<br/>So [1-4] has been played by 15% of the tickets.

* 60% of the tickets had 1 match and 6 combinations had 1 match : [1-2]  [1-3]  [1-5]  [2-4]  [3-4]  [4-5]. 
<br/>So we assume each of them have been played by 10% of the tickets.
  
* 25% of the tickets had no match and 3 combinations had 0 match : [2-3] [2-5] [3-5].
<br/>So we assume each of them have been played by 8.33% of the tickets.

The analysis of the 1st draw result allowed us to have a estimation of the playing frequency of each combination.  

**Let's compare:**
* The real playing frequency *(which is not supposed to be known)*
* Our estimation done by studying the public results of the first draw
* A naive estimation which attibutes an equal frequency of 10% for each combination

| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Real Playing Frequency| Est. using 1st Draw Result| Naive Estimation|
|---------:|----------:|----------------------:|--------------------------:|----------------:|
|         1|          2|                     20|                      10.00|               10|
|         1|          3|                     15|                      10.00|               10|
|         1|          4|                     15|                      15.00|               10|
|         1|          5|                      5|                      10.00|               10|
|         2|          3|                     15|                       8.33|               10|
|         2|          4|                     10|                      10.00|               10|
|         2|          5|                      5|                       8.33|               10|
|         3|          4|                      5|                      10.00|               10|
|         3|          5|                      5|                      10.00|               10|
|         4|          5|                      5|                       8.33|               10|

We can see our estimator is more accurate than the naive one : 
* A better or similar accuracy for 9 combinations out of 10
* An Mean Absolute Error of 4,3 vs 5.0


#### Estimation by studying all draws result

If we do the same with the results of the 3 past draws we obtain these 3 estimators:

| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Real Frequency| Est. using 1st Draw Result| Est. using 2nd Draw Result| Est. using 3rd Draw Result|
|----------:|----------:|--------------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|--------------------------:|
|          1|          2|           0.20|                       0.10|                       0.17|                       0.20|
|          1|          3|           0.15|                       0.10|                       0.17|                       0.11|
|          1|          4|           0.15|                       0.15|                       0.08|                       0.11|
|          1|          5|           0.05|                       0.10|                       0.08|                       0.11|
|          2|          3|           0.15|                       0.08|                       0.17|                       0.08|
|          2|          4|           0.10|                       0.10|                       0.08|                       0.11|
|          2|          5|           0.05|                       0.08|                       0.08|                       0.11|
|          3|          4|           0.05|                       0.10|                       0.08|                       0.11|
|          3|          5|           0.05|                       0.08|                       0.08|                       0.05|
|          4|          5|           0.05|                       0.10|                       0.05|                       0.05|

**Let's aggregate these 3 estimators into a single stronger estimator** like a RandomForest aggregate several decision trees.

There is a several way to aggregate these 3 estimators *([See Next-Steps](https://github.com/StephaneFeniar/Lottery-BestCombination/blob/master/README.md#next-steps))*  but here we will do it them by a simple mean.

| 1st Number| 2nd Number| Real Frequency| Aggregated Est.|
|----------:|----------:|--------------:|---------------:|
|          1|          2|           0.20|            0.16|
|          1|          3|           0.15|            0.13|
|          1|          4|           0.15|            0.11|
|          1|          5|           0.05|            0.10|
|          2|          3|           0.15|            0.11|
|          2|          4|           0.10|            0.10|
|          2|          5|           0.05|            0.09|
|          3|          4|           0.05|            0.10|
|          3|          5|           0.05|            0.07|
|          4|          5|           0.05|            0.07|

We can see our new estimator using all the past draws results is even more accurate than the estimator using only the first draw result: 

* A better accuracy for 8 combinations out of 10 
* An Mean Absolute Error of 2.9 vs 4.3
* The estimator recommends 2 good combinations: [3-5] [4-5] which have a low playing frequency.

**Now you're familliar by the approach let's apply it to a real lottery : [EuroMillions](https://github.com/StephaneFeniar/Lottery-BestCombination#application-to-a-real-lottery-euromillions).**
